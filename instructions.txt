hi guys this is the reset branch.

Follow the instructions below in the order and go to the next step only after completing the previous one.

1) create a file called "oops.txt" and copy 1 paragraph of lorem ipsum (or anything else)

2) Oops! that was a mistake reset back to the HEAD

3) check git status it should say "working tree clean"

4) There has been some manipulation with the instructions reset back one commit to see the actual instruction to go ahead
