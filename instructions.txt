hi guys this is the reset branch.

Follow the instructions below in the order and go to the next step only after completing the previous one.

1) create a file called "oops.txt" and copy 1 paragraph of lorem ipsum (or anything else)

2) add and commit this file

3) Ooh you had to add 2 paragraph but you dont want to add another commit so soft reset the commit that you did just now

4) check the git status

5) add 2nd paragraph to the file and check the status and diff with HEAD

6) Oops! you made a breaking change hard reset back to the HEAD

7) check git status it should say "working tree clean"

8) There has been some manipulation with the instructions hard reset back one commit to see the actual instruction to go ahead
