Follow the instructions below in the order and go to the next step only after completing the previous one.

1) create a file called "oops.txt" and copy 1 paragraph of lorem ipsum (or anything else)

2) Oops! that was a mistake reset back to the HEAD

3) check git status it should say "working tree clean"

4) Yay you reached the required commit

5) you can checkout to branch called "stash"
